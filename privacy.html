  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated: February 14, 2026</em></p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how The Adriatic ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and protects your personal information when you visit our website or subscribe to our newsletter.</p>

  <h2>Who We Are</h2>
  <p>The Adriatic is published by the Institute for Strategic Solutions (ISR), a consultancy based in Ljubljana, Slovenia. We publish essays, analysis, and commentary on politics, business, and culture from the Western Balkans and beyond.</p>
  <p>For privacy-related questions or requests, contact us at: <a href="mailto:info@isr.si">info@isr.si</a></p>

  <h2>What Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We collect minimal personal information necessary to provide our services:</p>

  <p><strong>Newsletter Subscriptions:</strong> When you subscribe to our newsletter, we collect your email address. This is the only personally identifiable information we actively collect.</p>

  <p><strong>Cookies and Analytics:</strong> Like most websites, we may use cookies to understand how visitors use our site. This helps us improve content and user experience. You can disable cookies through your browser settings, though some features may not work properly.</p>

  <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We use your email address solely to send you our biweekly newsletter and occasional updates about The Adriatic. We do not use your email for any other purpose, and we will never sell, rent, or share your email address with third parties for marketing purposes.</p>

  <h2>Email Service Provider</h2>
  <p>We use <a href="https://www.brevo.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brevo</a>, an EU-based email service provider, to manage our newsletter subscriptions and send emails. Brevo processes your email address on our behalf and stores it on secure servers within the European Union.</p>

  <p>Brevo is GDPR-compliant and acts as a data processor under our instruction. For details on how Brevo handles data, see their <a href="https://www.brevo.com/legal/privacypolicy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">privacy policy</a>.</p>

  <h2>Your Rights Under GDPR</h2>
  <p>As an EU-based publication, we comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). You have the following rights regarding your personal data:</p>

  <p><strong>Right to Access:</strong> You can request a copy of the personal information we hold about you.</p>

  <p><strong>Right to Rectification:</strong> If your information is incorrect or incomplete, you can ask us to correct it.</p>

  <p><strong>Right to Erasure:</strong> You can request that we delete your personal information. We will comply unless we have a legitimate reason to retain it (such as legal obligations).</p>

  <p><strong>Right to Object:</strong> You can object to how we process your data at any time.</p>

  <p><strong>Right to Data Portability:</strong> You can request your data in a structured, machine-readable format.</p>

  <p><strong>Right to Unsubscribe:</strong> Every newsletter email includes an unsubscribe link. You can opt out at any time, and we will remove your email from our list within 48 hours.</p>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We retain your email address for as long as you remain subscribed to our newsletter. If you unsubscribe, we will delete your information from our active mailing list, though we may retain minimal records (such as the fact that you previously subscribed) to comply with legal obligations or prevent re-subscription errors.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the internet is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Links</h2>
  <p>Our website may contain links to external sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of third-party websites. We encourage you to review their privacy policies before providing any personal information.</p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>Our website and newsletter are not intended for individuals under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. When we make significant changes, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page. Continued use of our services after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
